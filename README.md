# Apple catcher game - Vilayat Kleer

![Forest](docs/images/forest.png)

## What is this game about?

The game is made in Visual Studio Code, using Typescript. I had to make a game for my Programming 04 class using certain guidelines. I've made a bulletin with the features of the game:

- Start screen so you can choose when to play
- Control the basket snail using the [A] and [D] key
- The basket snail contains 2 objects: The snail and the basket. The snail spawns a basket on it's back, completing the composition
- The basket snail can catch apples through collision
- The snail, basket and apples have a parent class called gameobjects.ts, inheriting the variables through 'extends'
- All children access the variables using the 'super();'
- An on screen score counting how many apples you've caught
- An end screen when all the apples have dropped
- A restart button on the end screen so you can try to improve your score
- Using encapsulation to declare the variables

## Installation

To play the game you have to fork this repository and download the files. When the files have been downloaded, go to the 'docs' map and open 'index.html' to play the game. Have fun!
