# Apple catcher game - Vilayat Kleer

![Forest](docs/images/forest.png)

## What is this game about?

The game is made in Visual Studio Code, using Typescript. I had to make a game for my Programming 04 class using certain guidelines. I've made a bulletin with the features of the game:

- Control the basket using the [A] and [D] key
- The basket can catch apples through collision
- Both the basket and apples have a parent class called gameobjects.ts, inheriting the variables through 'extends'
- Both children acces the variables using the 'super();'
- An on screen score counting how many apples you've caught
- An end screen when all the apples have dropped
